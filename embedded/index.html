        <h3>Monkey for Embedded Linux</h3>
        <p>
          When dealing with Embedded Linux systems, flexibility is one of the main requirements. On the HTTP Server contexts,
          there is a special need to have such flexibility to include or remove specific features, resources
          usage is such important as a good performance, so we need a good balancing across these requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://monkey-project.com">Monkey</a> offers an optimized HTTP server through a small core for basic functionality
          and also offers the capacity to load/unload features on-demand based on it plugin system architecture. Such plugins can be
          build as built-in features (static mode) or loaded on runtime as shared libraries.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="http://monkey-project.com">We</a> are committed to provide a flexible server and provide all support required
          by the industry, we are a formal participant organization of <a href="http://www.yoctoproject.org">Yocto Project</a>
          where we put our efforts to distribute a stable and ready for production web server for the _Embedded Linux_ world.
