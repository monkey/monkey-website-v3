        <h3>About Monkey</h3>
        <p>
          Monkey is a lightweight and scalable Web Server. Originally made for Linux, it's also compatible with OSX. It have been designed with a strong focus on Embedded devices, therefore its scalable by nature having a low memory and CPU consumption, making it a real solution for high end production servers too.
        </p>
        <p>
          Monkey is built and tested for different architectures such as ARM, x86 and x64.

        <h3>Internals</h3>
        <p>
          Monkey uses an hybrid mechanism composed by a fixed number of threads being each one capable to attend thousands of clients thanks to the event-driven model based in asyncrhonous sockets.
        </p>
        <p>
          The interaction between the scheduler and each worker thread is lock free, avoiding race conditions and exposing a huge performance compared to other available options. It also takes the most of the Linux Kernel to optimize the work using specific system calls based on zero-copy strategy.

        <h3>Plugins</h3>
        <p>
          A good and flexible architecture is one of our goals. Monkey have been designed to keep most of the HTTP functionalities in the core and make it extensible through external plugins. Its core is small, depending of the compiler version used, the size of the runtime can be ~300KB. The current plugins are distributed with the sources:

          <ul>
            <li>SSL/TLS</li>
            <li>CGI: Common Gateway Interface</li>
            <li>FastCGI: Fast CGI</li>
            <li>Liana: networking communication layer</li>
            <li>Cheetah! Shell: Yes!, Monkey has a shell!</li>
            <li>Directory Listing</li>
            <li>Security: access restriction to the service by network address, subnets and request filters</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
